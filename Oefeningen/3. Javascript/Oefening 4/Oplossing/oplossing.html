                <tr><td>*****</td><td onclick="edit(this)">Compass Book Ratings</td><td>The Hobbit is arguably the best book I have ever read. It serves equally well as a children’s and adult book, is jam-packed with adventures, and is the perfect introduction to fantasy literature. It’s a great read-aloud for children as young as six or seven, but I wouldn’t recommend it for kids younger than 11 or 12 to read by themselves. The Hobbit is a wonderful story because it has almost the perfect dose of every story element. The overall plot is straightforward but filled with many sub-adventures. Although the beginning is a bit slow, especially for younger readers, as soon as the adventure truly begins (about 40 pages in) the story moves quickly. The characters are certainly different from those in the average modern children’s book. However, despite the cast being only adults and rarely humans, they still manage to be relatable, admirable, and intimidating by turns. Bilbo especially is an effective protagonist, with varying motivations and an approachable personality. And while Tolkien has a reputation for over-the-top worldbuilding, the worldbuilding in The Hobbit is notably easy to digest. Various fantastical creatures and settings are introduced, but they are so well integrated into the story that it’s simple to keep track of. The Hobbit is a classic in fantasy literature and has been popular since it was first published in 1937. I’ve never heard of anyone truly disliking it. So don’t hesitate to give it a read, and definitely share it with the children in your life.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>****</td><td>Goodreads</td><td>Books exist in time and place and our experience of them is affected by the specific time and place in which we encounter them. Sometimes an uplifting or inspiring book can change the path of a life that has wandered onto a wrong course. Sometimes a book, discovered early on, can form part of the foundation of who we are. Or, discovered late, can offer insight into the journey we have taken to date. Sometimes a book is just a book. But not The Hobbit. Not for me. In January, 2013, I pulled out my forty-year old copy in anticipation of seeing the recently released Peter Jackson film. It is a substantial book, heavy, not only with its inherent mass, but for the weight of associations, the sediment of time. The book itself is a special hard-cover edition published in 1973, leather bound, in a slipcase, the booty of new love from that era. The book, while victim to some internal binding cracks (aren't we all?) is still in decent shape, unlike that long-vanquished relationship. Not surprising. I had read the story six times and been there and back again with this particular volume five.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>*****</td><td>Alan K. Dell</td><td>Reading the words of The Hobbit myself for the first time was a great experience, and especially reading them aloud. My kids thoroughly enjoyed the story, though I think many of the environmental descriptions—which are vivid, but lengthy, as is typical of Tolkien—were lost on them, as well as the politics of the last few chapters. As much as the story overall had stuck with me over the years, there were a few things I had forgotten about the plot. This was probably for the best, because towards the latter parts of the book, I noticed the plot seemed to lose its way a bit in the tying up of loose ends. The death of Smaug was more anticlimactic than I remember, coming at the hands of a brand new character with whom we had no emotional connection. The following chapters felt like they were trying to inject that connection after-the-fact, and the battle of the five armies was more than a little contrived. The ultimate fate of Thorin and company made sense as a foil for their characters (particularly Thorin himself), but brought a low-note to what should have been the end of a grand adventure. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it went in a different direction and felt odd compared to the rest of the book. The characters for the most part are fantastic: Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Balin, Beorn, Bombur, Elrond, The Elvenking, The Trolls, Smaug, Gollum, and even Bard himself despite being introduced extremely late. The other dwarves of the company are a little bit interchangeable, and their initial presence was clearly to give reading out the roster comedic value. But when you introduce all these characters, you have to do something with them, and they didn’t necessarily add much. Consequently you don’t become quite so attached to them. Pacing was inconsistent, especially towards the end, which despite having very short chapters, felt like it dragged along. The first two-thirds of the book up to the point where Bilbo meets Smaug is excellent, and well-deserving of its beloved status. After that, like I said above, it starts to stumble a bit. I know I’m being pretty harsh and it sounds like I didn’t enjoy the book at all, but that’s far from the case. I don’t give much weight to many of these negatives, but they’re interesting observations to note and things I didn’t notice at all when the story was read to me as a child. They’re also probably things which my own children didn’t notice either, seeing as how the very moment I finished reading the final words of the last chapter, my daughter piped up, “You’re going to start it again tomorrow night, right?” Overall The Hobbit remains a brilliant read, great fun with lots of adventure and deep lore. I loved it; my children loved it, and it’s making me really want to try reading The Lord of the Rings again (fourth attempt’s a charm, right?)—though, I won’t be reading that to my children; we can watch the movies together instead.</td></tr>
